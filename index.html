            <p>Hello, my name is Sarah Reed. I recently changed it because I just got married at the beginning of the year. I now live in Rexburg, Idaho, since my husband goes to BYU-I. I am pursuing a software development degree to give me more work options, especially work-from-home jobs.</p>

                Idaho is in the Northwest part of the United States. It borders six states as well as Canada. It is mostly known for potatoes and is called the "Gem State" because most types of gemstones have been found here.
